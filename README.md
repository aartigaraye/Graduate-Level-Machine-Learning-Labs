Some of the project works I have been doing in a graduate machine learning class. These include clean, commented notebooks exploring different topics. I'm currently also working on a final project which will explore some original extension of an existing research paper. 

## 2018 US House Election 
Exploring what makes a model a "good" prediction model. We focus on evaluating the quality of election predictions made by the website [fivethirtyeight.com](https://www.fivethirtyeight.com). As one prominent example, fivethirtyeight predicted that Clinton had a 70.9% chance to win the election.  Was their model wrong?

To gain insight into questions like this, I'll focus on  [US House elections predictions from 2018](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/).  Their predictions are based predominantly on polling data but include other sources as well (state of the economy, overall favoriability of politic parties, etc).  

It is losely based on this [article](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/checking-our-work/).

## Exploratory Data Analysis In Professional Basketball
I conduct an exploratory data analysis of professional basketball data.  Basketball is a team sport in which the goal is to try to outscore the amount in a fixed amount of time. Points are scored (either 2 or 3 points) by putting the ball throw a hoop on one end of the court.  An attempt at putting the ball throw the hoop is known as a "shot".  If helpful, you can read more about [the rules of basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_basketball).

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the professional basketball league in the United States and provides a nice website with many statistics gathered on teams and players in the league: [http://stat.nba.com](http://stat.nba.com).
